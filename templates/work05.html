                            <p>Which Writing Skills Should You Have
                                Writing is a broad practice with plenty of different specialisms. As a marketer, you’ll
                                need to be well-versed in all types of writing, utilised in different areas of a
                                campaign and as part of the creation process.

                                Generally speaking, there are four types of writing you will want to master:

                                Persuasive Writing — Perhaps the most obvious of the four, you will need to know how to
                                make propositions attractive to generate sales from your advertisements.

                                Informational Writing — Marketers can often fall into sales-y scripture when sometimes
                                clarity and accuracy is what is needed. Informational writing has never been so in
                                demand.

                                Formal Writing — Formal writing has always been heavily involved in marketing for
                                professional pieces like journalistic reporting, press releases and whitepapers.
                                However, continued scrutiny on data regulations and increased transparency are forcing a
                                formal approach to become more commonplace as marketers explain policies, customer
                                rights and legislation.

                                Informal Writing — Most advertising is written in an informal style, as though brands
                                are chatting to a group of friends. You will deploy informal writing in captivating
                                email
                                marketing headlines, entertaining blogs and engaging website copy to name a few formats.

                            <br>
                            <p>Here are a few writing formats marketers will need to master:
                                <br><br>
                            <h5> &bull; Blogs</h5>
                            <br>
                            <h5>&bull;Articles</h5>
                            <br>
                            <h5>&bull; Whitepapers</h5>
                            <br>
                            <h5>&bull; Press Releases</h5>
                            <br>

                            <h5>&bull; Email Marketing</h5>
                            <br>

                            <h5>&bull; Social Media</h5>
                            <br>
                            <h5>&bull; Advertising and flyers</h5>
                            <br>
                            That is right. Marketing managers, in particular, will need to sharpen their written
                            skills to deliver effective communication to more than just their brand target
                            audience.

                            As a manager, you will need to be able to write compelling yet clear briefs for your
                            team
                            to follow and give eloquent and tactful feedback, as well as possess an entire range of
                            other communication skills.

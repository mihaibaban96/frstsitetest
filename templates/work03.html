                            <p>The marketing of products or services using electrical equipment is called digital
                                marketing. The most common type of digital marketing is internet marketing.

                                Digital marketing is the collection of all the marketing activities we do either
                                digitally or online. Before we go any further, it’s essential to understand what digital
                                marketing involves. Here is a simple list:
                                <br>
                                <b>SEO</b>
                                Search engine optimization is improving the quality and quantity of website traffic
                                based on the page rank of websites or search engines. It also helps to improve search
                                engines.
                                <br>
                                <b>SMO</b>
                                Social Media Optimization (SMO) uses social media (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.)
                                to regulate and increase online engagement. As a marketing number, the press will raise
                                awareness of new products or services and connect with customers.

                                Email Marketing
                                Email marketing is another effective marketing method based on sending emails and
                                building relationships with potential customers and clients. A good email marketing
                                strategy can turn sales leads into customers and new customers into repeat customers.

                                Content Marketing
                                Marketing tools within content marketing that aim to create and distribute valuable,
                                relevant and lasting content that attracts positive customers.
                                <br>
                                <b>SEM</b>
                                Search engine marketing is one of the most popular types of contextual advertising.
                                Advertisers can request ads added to a search engine-sponsored link when someone
                                searches for a keyword that is relevant to their intended business.

                            <p>React.js is one such Javascript library that has achieved massive popularity within the
                                domain of online, web-based businesses and that too for a perfectly good reason. The one
                                thing that it does exceptionally well — carve out great looking user interfaces (UI).
                                With the principle that HTML and JavaScript are bound to collaborate side-by-side, React
                                was created with a business-forward mindset by leveraging faster web-page load speed,
                                SEO friendliness and code reusability through combining the two technologies.
                                Features of React:
                                Easy to learn
                                There is a shorter learning curve involved in understanding React compared to other
                                comprehensive libraries.


                                Boost In Performance
                                React itself is sufficient in creating awesome looking front-end designs and combined
                                with its super fast rendering capabilities is a natural fit for companies to utilize it
                                in their services.


                                SEO Integration
                                This particular aspect is essential for the success of businesses because faster speed
                                is directly proportional to more users which converts to main goal of companies:
                                Revenue.


                                Ease of Migration
                                React is lightweight and practically wrapped around the same JavaScript standards that
                                made developers and manager alike, to fall in love with this language in the first
                                place. React code can be added anywhere onto existing infrastructure without worry of
                                shutting down the system for maintenance and also less dependency to reinvent the wheel
                                hence making it quite easier for migration.
